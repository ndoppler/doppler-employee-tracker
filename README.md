# doppler-employee-tracker

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to build a CLI application that allowed the user to view departments, role and employees in a company. It also allowed the user to update an employee's role, as well as add new departments roles and employees. I had functionality that accepted user text and selections via inquirer and utilized the pg package and postgres database to query and perform CRUD operations on the data.

## Description
This App allows users to view, update, and create departments, roles, and employees in their company from a CLI application.
